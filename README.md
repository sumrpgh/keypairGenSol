**How it works**

Open the folder in the terminal. 
Write in the following in the terminal:

.\vanity_solana.exe {name} {0 for case-insensitive and 1 for case-sensitive}

example:

.\vanity_solana.exe test 0 <br />
The above will find a keypair that starts with test (case insensitive)
Currently the script can only find keys that starts with a certain prefix.

Note: It uses a lot of pc recourses.
